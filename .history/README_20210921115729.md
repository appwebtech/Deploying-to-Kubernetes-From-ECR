# Deploying Images to Kubernetes from Private Docker Repository

## Common Workflow

A common workflow to deploy your app to K8 entails;

* Commit to Git that triggers Jenkins CI build
* Jenkins packages your app into a Docker image
* Docker image gets pushed to a Docker registry (Public/Private)
* Get docker image to K8s cluster (But how in a private repo?)

To pull an image from a private registry eg Nexus, private Dockerhub registry, there are two main steps to follow.

1. Create **Secret** component in K8s
   * contains access tokens and credentials for Docker registry
2. Configure Deployment/Pod
   * To use Secret leveraging **imagePullSets**
