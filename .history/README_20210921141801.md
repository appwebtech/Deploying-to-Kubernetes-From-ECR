# Deploying Images to Kubernetes from Private Docker Repository

## Common Workflow

A common workflow to deploy your app to K8 entails;

* Commit to Git that triggers Jenkins CI build
* Jenkins packages your app into a Docker image
* Docker image gets pushed to a Docker registry (Public/Private)
* Get docker image to K8s cluster (But how in a private repo?)

To pull an image from a private registry eg Nexus, private Dockerhub registry, there are two main steps to follow.

1. Create **Secret** component in K8s
   * contains access tokens and credentials for Docker registry
2. Configure Deployment/Pod
   * To use Secret leveraging **imagePullSets**

I will be using a private docker repo hosted in AWS ECR and to ready the process I have build my image locally with a Dockerfile, pushed it to Amazon ECR, named it **my-app:1.0** . It's an **NodeJS** app packaged locally.

Locally I've readied my local development area and my Minikube cluster is empty. I've also authenticated my local environment with AWS by retrieving an authentication token from AWS and authenticating my Docker client to my registry.

Since Minikube has no access to ECR, I'll configure it with my AWS credentials to enable login directly.
